This is my language for Scripts subject
Language bases on three things:
•almost all information stored in "memory
•functions and arguments should be written one after another separated by spaces
•when you call variable, you use it's ordinal number in memory (after last commits you can use words, but it takes mush more memory than numeric identifiers.

interpretator has two modes of work:
•file interpretation - you give file name as an argument #1 and interpretator runs it.
•console mode - you give "console" as an argument #1 and you get "console". e.g. you should write functions and arguments for functions and it will be processed in real-time.

language has nearly 39 functions (number in brackets is an argument count):
•read[1]
•write[1]
•writeLn[1]
•write@[1]
•writeLn@[1]
•goto[1]
•+[2]
•-[2]
•*[2]
•//[2]
•%[2]
•|[2]
•=[2]
•if [1] ... [else] end
•and[3]
•or[3]
•==[3]
•not[2]
•>[3]
•>=[3]
•<[3]
•<=[3]
